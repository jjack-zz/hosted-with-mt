hosted-with-mt
==============

A lightweight Chrome extension that shows whether or not you're browsing a website hosted
with (mt) Media Temple, Inc.

Because Chrome extensions do not have the ability to resolve a site's IP address, there's
also a tiny node.js application that resolves them.

Install it: http://rocketscientry.com/chrome/hosted-with-mt.crx
